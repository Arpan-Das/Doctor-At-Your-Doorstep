Hello EveryOne

#first time user
1) clone the repo

    a)copy the ssh key from the code(green color button on the top right side)
    
    b) go to your system -> go the the folder where you want to store Your Project
    
    c) open the git bash on that folder 
    
    d) then run this code 
    
        >git clone git@github.com:Arpan-Das/Doctor_At_Your_Footstep.git
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this is the ssh you copy in the step (a)
                           
    e) Woooooooo Your project is ready to go (just few more step)
    
2) Now you must have cloned the repo so now go to the /frontend folder and run the command

    >npm install
    (this command will help you to install all the dependencies for the project)
    
    NOTE:: till now we have nothing in the /backend folder that's why you did not need to run the npm install on that folder 
    
 ##
 
 Now for the command to push and pull of the project
